# hello-world
Finally getting started with Git (and my startup)

I first started programming BASIC back in 1982 on a Sinclair ZX81. At the American school in Saudi Arabia I attended we got to try out LOGO and Turtle Graphics. I even wrote an Excel-like software in high school, in GFA BASIC on an Atari ST (it was a Pascal clone). But for most of my adult life I've been a designer and strategist. I've missed programming, so I'm starting up some projects on Github for my enjoyment and to try out some ideas that have been occupying my mind.
